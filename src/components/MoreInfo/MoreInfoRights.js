        <h3>RETURNS PROCESS/YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS</h3>
        <p>If you wish to return goods purchased online or over the phone, you should notify Hi-Fi Corner of your intention to do so within 14 days of the date of receipt. You then have an additional 14 days to return the goods from this notification date (goods must be returned within 28 days). We will in such circumstances refund you the cost of your order, excluding postage or delivery cost. However, if goods are not returned "as new" due to excessive handling on your part, or with components missing (including packing materials and manuals) we may make a reasonable deduction for this. Please do not send your product back to the manufacturer. We kindly ask that to make the refund process easier that you include your receipt or proof of purchase and a cover letter detailing briefly why the item is being returned. We cannot refund the cost of delivery fees if there was an additional charge, only the cost of the goods themselves. We will process the refund when the item arrives with us. If you are shipping an item over Â£100, we would advise using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned item. Please contact us before attempting to return your goods. For purchases bought in-store, you can also drop in and be refunded instantly.
