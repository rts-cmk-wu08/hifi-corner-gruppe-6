          <h3>History</h3>
          <h3 className="orange">
            Established in the late 1960s, our family owned business is based in
            Edinburgh and Falkirk, but services customers across the UK.{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our Edinburgh branch has the longest history as an audio retailer in
            the UK. During recent renovations, receipts were found from
            Nicolson’s Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In the 1950s WG
            Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham’s Hi-Fi Corner.
            Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and shortened
            the name to Hi-Fi Corner.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon thereafter a young enthusiastic Colin MacKenzie (left), who was
            recommended by Linn’s own Ivor Tiefenbrun, was employed to manage
            the shop; with a knack for business and years of experience in the
            hi-fi industry, Colin would later become the owner of Hi-Fi Corner.
            Today, Struan MacKenzie carries on the legacy as the company’s
            Managing Director.{" "}
